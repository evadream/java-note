# 什么是建造者模式
> Builder design pattern is the first pattern belonging to the family of creational patterns.
 This pattern is used to simplify the construction of complex objects. To understand the concept,
 imagine an object illustrating programmer's CV. In this object we want to store the personal 
 information (first name, address etc.) as well as technical information (knowing languages, realized projects etc.).
  The construction of this object could look like:
  1. 用途
  以链式方式实例话对象
  2. 意义
  其实是内部静态类的典型应用
